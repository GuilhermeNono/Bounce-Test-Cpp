# Bounce-Test-Cpp

A simple interactive project designed to demonstrate the integration of Flecs and Raylib, showcasing how to use an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture to build dynamic and efficient 2D game mechanics.

## Features

- **Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture**: Utilizes Flecs for efficient entity management.
- **2D Graphics**: Uses Raylib for rendering.
- **Interactive Demo**: Shows dynamic interactions between entities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake
- Flecs
- Raylib

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeNono/Bounce-Test-Cpp.git
    cd Bounce-Test-Cpp
    ```

2. **Build the project**:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. **Run the executable**:
    ```sh
    ./Bounce-Test-Cpp
    ```

## Usage

- The demo will start with a basic screen showing bouncing entities.
- Modify the source code to add more entities or change their behaviors.
